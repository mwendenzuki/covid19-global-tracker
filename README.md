# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A data analysis project exploring the global trends of the COVID-19 pandemic using real-world data from **Our World in Data**. This Jupyter Notebook tracks and compares cases, deaths, and vaccination rollouts in selected countries — Kenya, India, and the USA — with a focus on insights, clarity, and clean visual storytelling.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze and visualize time-based trends (cases, deaths, and vaccinations)
- Compare pandemic impact across countries
- Generate narrative insights and report findings
- Present an exploratory notebook suitable for presentation or publication

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- `pandas` for data handling and cleaning
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- (Optional: `plotly` or `geopandas` for mapping)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-global-tracker.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   cd covid19-global-tracker

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

   jupyter notebook

4. Open the .ipynb file and run the cells in sequence.

💡 Note: Ensure the owid-covid-data.csv file is in the same directory as the notebook.

## 🔍 Insights & Reflections

- The USA reported the highest total cases and deaths overall, with multiple sharp peaks.
- India experienced a dramatic mid-2021 wave but caught up quickly on vaccinations.
- Kenya had a relatively lower case count and death rate, possibly due to early interventions and demographics.
- Vaccination rollout speed and reach strongly influenced case and mortality trends across countries.
- This project reinforced the importance of clean data, thoughtful visualizations, and clear storytelling in transforming raw numbers into meaningful public health insights.
